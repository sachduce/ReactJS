## Assignment 


*  Rebuild the Todo List app with a richer frontend - as displayed in the following mockup 

	- Mockup -   [https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9VONv-Dn2w1UmMyUVZlUDJTeWc/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9VONv-Dn2w1UmMyUVZlUDJTeWc/view?usp=sharing)
	- Alternate Link - [http://imgur.com/a/1ym6S](http://imgur.com/a/1ym6S)

	- The frontend for this app contains four sections
		1. Active Todos : This section displays all active todos. Clicking the checkbox completes the todo. Clicking the red X deletes the todo. 
	   2. Add Todo : This section lets you add a todo (with status Active)
	   3. Completed Todos : This section displays completed todos. Clicking the checkbox makes the todo active (again). Clicking the red X deletes the todo. 
	   4. Deleted Todos : Displays list of deleted todos
	
	- Notes
	  1. Primarily focus on completing the feature set - more weightage in evaluation (50%)
	  2. Looks are secondary - less weightage in evaluation (25%). For eg. if you are unable to add a checkbox - then add a simple button with the text 'Mark As Complete' on it. 
	  3. Weightage for code quality, styling and documentation is 25% 
	  4. You can use Twitter Bootstrap to style the web page. (Tutorial : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/bootstrap/index.htm) 
	  5. Optional (Bonus) Features  : The "Hide Completed Items" link hides the "Completed Todos" section. Similarly the "Hide Deleted" Items" link hides the "Deleted Todos" section. 

	  
* Hook the frontend code with the existing code for the Node API server that we built in class with the following 4 endpoints -  

 - GET /api/todos
 - POST /api/todos
 - PUT /api/todos/:id
 - DELETE /api/todos:id



* Commit your code to a repository on your Github profile. Share the URL for the repository via email

 - To : ankit@codingblocks.com
 - From : your-nagarro-email-id
 - Subject : Todo List Assignment Name Employee ID
 - Body : Github Repository URL
  

*  Organise your code with the following directory structure

	- App/index.js (express server) 
	- App/public/ (public assets)
	- App/public/index.html (this is the frontend app served at localhost:4000)
	- App/public/script.js (all frontend JS code goes here)
	- App/package.json
	- App/README.md (documentation) 
	- App/screenshots/ (once your app is ready, take a couple of screenshots of the app running in your browser and upload them in this directory)
		
* Don't upload the node_modules directory (Use .gitignore)
* You can take suggestions from [this template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) for README.md 
* Also add sections in README.md for "Features Built", "Features Not Built", "Known Issues"

* Make a commit after building each sub-feature. For a sample commit history look at [https://github.com/malikankit/ng-aug-todo-app/commits/master] (https://github.com/malikankit/ng-aug-todo-app/commits/master)
